# hi

I'm attila, I mostly work on proprietary software, some F/OSS stuff
when well-aspected.  I have a poorly-maintained
[blog](https://haqistan.net), just like all the other suckers.

  - C/Unix/BSD, Perl, Python, Yacc/Lex/Lemon/Greg/etc.
  - PostgreSQL is my one and only storage layer above BSD Unix

Be safe out there, or at least lie about it.

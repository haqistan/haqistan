# hi

I'm attila, I've mostly worked on proprietary software over the last 40+ years,
some F/OSS stuff when well-aspected.  I have a poorly-maintained
[blog](https://haqistan.net), just like all the other suckers.

  - C/Unix/BSD, Perl, Python, Yacc/Lex/Lemon/Greg/etc.
  - PostgreSQL is my one and only storage layer
  - Do One Thing Well

Be safe out there.
